# typescript is nothing more than a dev tool (a wrapper around the js)
if we write tsc filename.ts then it generate a js file of that

# types 
- boolean
- string
- number
- Null
- undefined
- void
- object
- array
- tuples
- Any --> not recommend ( then there is no use of writng in typescript as it will work similar to js, (makes more vulnerable))
- Never
- Unknown

# Syntax
# all types are in lower (string,number...)
let variableName:type=value
let name:string="tenzin"

# complusory or not
in case of variable not giving type is fine
but in case of function it is mandatory as 
the parameter is pass
